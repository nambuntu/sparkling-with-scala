# Sparkling with Scala
**Demonstration of some well-known ML technique using Spark, Dataframe using Scala**

* For latest Spark docs: [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html)
* For latest Scala reference: [https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html)
* Project is built with SBT 1.x [https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/)

To make it simple I just extends every runnable class with App Trait from Scala to quickly create an executable scala program

Cheers!
